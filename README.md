### What I learned

How to make a mobile menu with Javascript

```css
.menu-nav {
	position: absolute;
	overflow-x: hidden;
	top: 0;
	right: 0;
	list-style-type: none;
	height: 100%;
	width: 0;
	opacity: 0;
	padding-top: 150px;
	background-color: hsl(36, 100%, 99%);
	transition: all 0.5s ease;
}
.menu-nav.active {
	opacity: 1;
	width: 70%;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to refine my DOM manipulation skills and be able to use Javascript for more complex website behaviours

### Useful resources

[https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/]- This is an amazing article which helped me reallly understand and use grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
